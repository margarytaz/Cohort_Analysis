### **Analysis Workflow** 📊

A four-stage process was performed to transform raw data into a comprehensive analysis.

* **Data Extraction & Cleaning (SQL):** A dataset of *2,381 rows* and *10 columns* was queried from a BigQuery database, ensuring data integrity by checking for duplicates and missing values.
  
* **Data Enrichment & Quality Check (Google Sheets):** The extracted dataset was imported into Google Sheets for a final manual quality check. An additional column ('Week') was added to prepare the data for cohort analysis.
  
* **Descriptive Statistics (Python):** Using a Google Colab notebook, a Python script calculated key metrics, including *Total Revenue ($34,963.15)* and *Average Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) ($14.68)*. The data was then grouped and analyzed by category, country, and cohort to reveal preliminary insights.
  
* **Visualization & Deep Analysis (Tableau):** The cleaned dataset was loaded into Tableau to create an interactive dashboard focused on cohort-specific behavior, which provided the most impactful findings and supported data-driven recommendations.

### **Key Findings & Recommendations** ✅

The analysis revealed several critical insights that form the basis for strategic recommendations for marketing and sales teams.

**1. Tablets Drive the Highest Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** 📱
* **Finding:** While desktop and mobile users represent the majority of customers and revenue, tablet users have a significantly higher average CLV of *$17.09*. This identifies tablet users as a high-value customer segment.
* **Recommendation:** Investigate the specific user experience and behavior of tablet customers. Consider launching a targeted campaign or optimizing the interface for tablet users to capitalize on this valuable segment.

**2. Newer Cohorts Show Superior Conversion and Value** 🚀
* **Finding:** The most recent cohorts (2020-12-06 and 2020-12-13) exhibit a rapid conversion rate and high initial value. The *2020-12-13* cohort achieved a *100% conversion rate* within its first week with the average CLV of *$18.13*, significantly exceeding the overall average. These two cohorts also display a notably higher *Average Revenue per User (ARPU)* in their early weeks compared to all previous cohorts. This indicates a successful strategy in user acquisition or marketing campaing in the recent period.
* **Recommendation:** Conduct a deeper analysis of the acquisition channels and strategies used for these high-performing cohorts. The goal is to identify and replicate these successful methods to boost conversion speed and value for future user groups.

**3. Revenue is Highly Concentrated in Top 4 Countries** 🌍
* **Finding:** The United States, India, Canada, and the United Kingdom are the top four countries by revenue and user count. Together they account for *68.3% of total revenue*. The United States is the primary market, generating over *$16,000* in revenue.
* **Recommendation:** Focus sales and marketing efforts on these core markets, as they are the main revenue drivers. Simultaneously, explore opportunities for growth in other high-performing regions by creating localized promotions or content to increase their user base and revenue.

**4. Revenue Declines Post-Purchase** 📉
* **Finding:** The "Weekly Average Revenue Per User" analysis shows a consistent decline in user value after the initial purchase. While the average order value (AOV) remains stable, the lack of repeat purchases is a challenge for long-term growth.
* **Recommendation:** Develop targeted retention strategies to re-engage users after their first purchase. This could include personalized email campaigns, loyalty programs, or promotions to encourage a second transaction and increase CLV.

### **Tools and Technologies** 

The project was conducted using a combination of tools, including SQL, Python, and Tableau.
* **SQL (BigQuery):** Used for initial data extraction and cleaning from a relational database.
* **Google Sheets:** Utilized for initial manual inspection after extraction and dataset enrichment.
* **Python (Google Colab):** Employed for descriptive statistics and data manipulation using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* **Tableau:** The primary tool for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards to uncover deeper insights for each of the cohorts.

### **How to Use This Repository**

This repository is structured to allow for a full review of the project's workflow. Here's a guide to navigating the files:
* **sql/:** Contains the SQL script used to query the dataset from BigQuery. You can review the data extraction and cleaning query [here](sql/clv_analysis.sql).
* **notebook/:** The [Google Colab notebook .ipynb file](notebook/CLV_Analysis.ipynb) with the Python code for data cleaning and descriptive statistics. You can run this notebook directly in your browser by clicking the [Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YaF-dJKxhayXqjTTRKofV1kw8sV825IP?usp=sharing). **Note:** you need to have Google account and upload *clv_analysis.csv* file to your Drive. Then you need to update the second code cell in the notebook to define the path to this file in your Drive.  
* **data/:** This folder contains the cleaned [clv_analysis.csv](data/clv_analysis.csv) dataset used in the analysis.
* **tableau/:** The Tableau workbook is developed in Tableau Public and can be accessed via this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/workfile_17580193858470/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
